The Crossing Game consists of 6 lanes, 4 of which contain vehicles and animals (the 2nd, 
the 3rd, the 4th and the 5th), including dinosaur, truck, car and bird.

You will start from the 6th lane (the lane at the bottom of the screen) and use the arrow 
keys to move as follows:

                 UP			
        LEFT            RIGHT 
                DOWN                
   
(There are some keys used to pause the game or exit,... find out more when you enter the game!)

Try to use those keys above to move the character through the lanes to hit the 1st lane 
(the lane at the top of the screen) without crashing vehicles/ animals. 

- If crash, you lose. 

- If you hit the 1st lane, you will be leveled up. 

Our game has 5 levels, if you pass 5 levels you will win.

Thank you for choosing our game! Wish you have fun!
