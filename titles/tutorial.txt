The Crossing Game consists of 6 lanes. In which there are 4 lanes for vehicles / animals
to travel: 2, 3, 4, 5. Types of vehicles and animals include: dinosaur, truck, car and bird.

You will start from lane 6 (the lane is at the bottom of the screen) and use the arrow 
keys to move as follows:

                 UP			
        LEFT            RIGHT 
                DOWN                
   
(There are some keys used to pause the game or exit,... find out more when you enter the game!)

Try to use the keys above to move the character so that it passes the lanes to go to 1st lane 
(the top lane of the screen) without touching any obstacles. 

- If you touch, you lose. 

- If you reach first lane, you will be leveled up. 

Our game has 5 levels, if you pass 5 levels you will win.
